# Game Idea: Swan

* Working title: Swan (maybe the final name should be 'Project: Swan'?)
* 2D tile-based platformer-esque game
* Circuit network shit
* Move along a third axis, the Z axis
	* "Dimentional Shifter"
* Mobs ofc
* Some kind of crafting? IDK
* Progression?
	* Minecraft-like exploration-driven progression with no clear path?
	* Terraria-like linear-ish boss-driven progression?
* Power system
	* Circuit network shit requires power
	* Maybe emulate a simplified electrical system?
	* Transistors could be the core, where power flows from A to B if C is
	  receiving power (B = C ? A + C : 0)
	* Everything (pistons, doors, gates, sensors, whatever) uses power
	* Power gen could be one of the main "goals" of the game
* Turing machines?
	* Idk, had this idea for a minecraft mod once.
	* A robot which runs a dialect of Brainfuck with some extra operations for
	  I/O to interact with the world.
